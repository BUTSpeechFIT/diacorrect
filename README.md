## Error Correction Back-end for Speaker Diarization
This repository provides a PyTorch implementation for DiaCorrect by Brno University of Technology. By exploiting the interactions between the input recording and the initial systemâ€™s outputs, DiaCorrect can automatically refine the initial speaker activities to minimize the diarization errors. We focus on two scenarios:
- ground-truth labels in target-domain are not provided
- the pre-trained diarization system is taken as a black-box, only inference is available

For the first case, when using [EEND-EDA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09921.pdf) as an initial model, DiaCorrect trained on simulated data can achieve similar performance on CALLHOME 2-speaker subset as the initial model fine-tuned on real data. For the second case, when a small development set is available, DiaCorrect can be trained directly on it and also reach similar performance as the initial model fine-tuned.

More details can be found in [DiaCorrect: Error Correction Back-end For Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08377).


## Usage
Please replace the correct data path at first. Main steps are:
- prepare [simulated conversations](https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/EEND_dataprep).
- prepare a pre-trained EEND-EDA model. See our [implementation](https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/EEND). 
- perform data pruning for the first case. `bash scripts/data_pruning.sh`
- prepare initial speaker activity predictions. `bash scripts/infer_sap.sh`
- model trainining. `python diacorrect/train.py -c conf/train_*.yaml`
- inference. `bash scripts/infer_correct.sh`

## Results
We present DiaCorrect performance when training from scratch with real-labeled data.
